This is basically the TODO list for the SOC work. As always, items to be
completed are marked with an "+", done items are "-". This list is subject to
change during the work.

- checkout the code and make sure it builds and runs on your machine. set up a
  comfortable working environment
- take this list, identify dependencies between items and reorder to your
  liking. please note that it might be a good idea to have a deep pipeline as
  you might need to wait on people every now and then. larger items or sets of
  smaller ones should have a time budget associated
- find potential problems that we need to write tests for: read through policy,
  check other tools and talk to people who might have ideas
	+ Verify that nothing depends on Essential packages
	+ Look for loops among Essential packages (from vorlon on NMTask list)
	+ Verify that a runtime library's version matches the version of its
	  corresponding -dev package
- talk to people about debgraph, they might have input. this is also important
  because we need to "sell" this a little bit
	* Completed by 10 June
	+ Bill Allombert would like to be able to check upgrade paths
		* Generate a set of packages that can be installed together
		  (without conflicting dependencies)
		* Formally:
			Given a family of sets Etch=S_1 U S_2 U S_3 U ... S_n
			Card(S_i)=1000
			n is not too far from Card(Etch)/1000
		* Then install each set S_i (with dependencies) and upgrade it
		  to Lenny
- based on these findings, define the set of operators, their interface and what
  types of things they return. talk over with mentor.  make a decision
  on the set of operators to implement by 15 June.
	- Define generic interface
	* Possible operators
		(Essential)
		- Count nodes in a graph (implemented as Graph member function)
		- Compute intersection of two sets of nodes 
		- Compute union of two sets of nodes
		- Compute xor of two sets of nodes
		- Compute difference of two sets of nodes
		- Find/filter nodes based on property values
		(Useful)
		+ State machine to track traversal info (cf. next two items):
		  follow edges of type X and terminate on nodes of type Y
		- Recursively find nodes' dependencies
			+ Do not include the "source" node(s) in the results
		- Recursively find nodes' dependents (traverse edges in reverse)
			+ Do not include the "source" node(s) in the results
		- Merge ("Canonify"?) subgraphs (or maybe merge sets of nodes into 
		  a single node in order to simulate a virtual package?)
		    * Implemented as mergePackageVersions() member of DGOperator
		+ Invert node selection (complement)
		- Find cycles (e.g., recursive depends/conflicts)
			- Handle disconnected components (islands) correctly
			+ Need to be able to specify the type of cycle (depends,
			  conflicts, etc.)
			+ Flag to follow the same architecture throughout
			+ Return a useful result (set of Graphs?)
		(Exotic)
		+ TBD
- implement them. this is a "milestone delivery", to be completed by 10
  July
+ perhaps one or more operators will be quite complicated and require a small
  parser (e.g. something like a state machine), so be prepared for the work
- sketch up a language that can be used to query the graph. talk over with
  mentor
  	- Planning to use Lua as our embedded interpreter
	- Need to write glue code that exports debgraph functions to Lua
	- Functions to export
		- loadPackages(dir): process all 'Packages' files in 'dir'
		- getNodes(Graph): return an array of nodes in the graph
		- getProperty(Node, Property): return a Node property
		- each operator can be instantiated and run
			* e.g., Union() returns a graph
			* these can be combined: Union(XOR(G1, G2), Intersect(G3, G4))
	- Glue details
		* OO is not really an option due to excessive duplication.  Each
		  "object" carries a copy of its methods, so any benefits of OO
		  would come with a significant memory hit
		- Need to maintain linkage between graphs in Lua and their
		  respective instance in C
		- Error facility to report problems back to Lua (e.g. "node not found")
	* EX (using standalone Lua interpreter):
		./debgraph_cli
		> loadPackages()
		[...]
		> rootNode = getNodes(Filter(id="RELEASE_UNSTABLE"))[0]
		> components = FindCycles(rootNode, {"CONTAINS","DEPENDS", "PREDEPENDS"})
		> for comp in components do
		    print("{");
			for node in comp do
			  print(getProperty(node, "Name"))
			  print(" ")
			end
			print("\n")
		  end <ENTER>
		{ libc6, libgcc }
	* EX (Filter)
		[...]
		-- For one criterion:
		> Filter(g, "Section", "EQUALS", "foo")
		-- For finding the union of several criteria:
		> Filter(g, "AND", {{"Section", "EQUALS", "foo"}, {"Maintainer", "NEQUALS", "Julian"}})

- implement it. "milestone delivery"
+ small pdf text or presentation that explains debgraph to a potential user (who
  might need convincing)
+ write test suite for operators and query language with reasonable code 
  coverage
+ improve performance
	+ profile the codebase to find duplicated or unnecessary work
	+ use a hash instead of a map for storing nodes: lookup O(1) vs. O(log n)
+ write user and developer documentation for the graph operators,
  language, etc.  to be completed by 11 August
