This is basically the TODO list for the SOC work. As always, items to be
completed are marked with an "+", done items are "-". This list is subject to
change during the work.

+ checkout the code and make sure it builds and runs on your machine. set up a
  comfortable working environment
+ take this list, identify dependencies between items and reorder to your
  liking. please note that it might be a good idea to have a deep pipeline as
  you might need to wait on people every now and then. larger items or sets of
  smaller ones should have a time budget associated
+ find potential problems that we need to write tests for: read through policy,
  check other tools and talk to people who might have ideas
+ talk to people about debgraph, they might have input. this is also important
  because we need to "sell" this a little bit
+ based on these findings, define the set of operators, their interface and what
  types of things they return. talk over with mentor.
+ implement them. this is a "milestone delivery"
+ perhaps one or more operators will be quite complicated and require a smal
  parser (e.g. something like a state machine), so be prepared for the work
+ sketch up a language that can be used to query the graph. talk over with
  mentor
+ implement it. "milestone delivery"
+ small pdf text or presentation that explains debgraph to a potential user (who
  might need convincing)
