===========
Debgraph is intended to be a generic graph analysis framework suitable to find
interesting constellations in the debian package dependency graph. In order to
do so, it builds a massive directed graph with typed nodes and edges, and
name-value properties on both. A set of standard operators can be combined with
generic C++ code and scripting to create meaningfull output

Building
--------
Should be straight forward: run make. Should not require anything that is not
build-essential, should you encounter any problems (e.g. incompatibilities with
a compiler), shout. A fancier build system is probably needed at some point, but
in the moment the simplicity of the current one is quite nice

Running
-------
a "make run" will do the trick. this will first run all scripts in "scripts"
that start with an "S" (Start) in their lexical order (think init...), then run
the debgraph executable and then all the "F" (Finish) scripts. The Finish
scripts are supposed to do things like convert images etc. The most important
"S" script is the one that downloads the packages files (and others). It will
download a fairly large amount of data, so you might not want to run it over and
over again. In the moment it will not update the data if it is not older than a
day, during development i just stick in another "exit 0" to make sure it never
downloads anything. There are also "C" scripts that are used to clean up. The
results of the run will be found in "out".
