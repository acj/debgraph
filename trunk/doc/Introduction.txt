- Overview -

DebGraph is a tool that provides a simple, intuitive interface to the
Debian package graph.  The package graph contains information about
packages (name, version, description, etc), their dependencies, and
other useful details.  By providing an easy way to interact with this
graph, DebGraph enables useful analyses that can identify interesting or
problematic constellations.

As an example, it is helpful for the Debian QA team to track cyclic
dependencies (that is, packages that [in]directly depend on themselves).
Such dependency cycles can be symptoms of package problems, and
therefore it is important that there is tool support for locating and
tracking them.

To date, many tools have been written to perform various tasks that
involve analyzing Debian packages.  The `lintian' tool performs tests on
packages to ensure that they are complete.  `Britney', another package
analysis tool, assists the release and quality assurance teams by
verifying package dependencies before promoting packages from the
`unstable' distribution to `testing'.
