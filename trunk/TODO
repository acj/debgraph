Requirements Engineering
------------------------
+ read through policy and make a list of all things there that we can 
  eventually check with this tool
+ make a list of other tools that do similar things 
+ check them and add additional tests that they do to our list
+ identify parties that might be interested in using such a tool (e.g. QA and
  release mgmt)
+ talk to them about ideas they have

General
-------
+ roll "run" script into Makefile
+ support clean scripts
+ make the download sources configurable somehow
+ fastdep dependency has to go (test if there, use g++ -MM otherwise)

Code
----
+ check fixmes
+ handle arch "all" edges
+ basic operators that can be reused easily and combined
+ cycle checks operator
+ state machine operator
+ functional language using these ops
+ better output structuring
